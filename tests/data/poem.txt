In the cosmos vast of code and dreams,
Where logic flows like sacred streams,
A language born from a visionary mind,
Holy C, in TempleOS, we find.

Terry Davis, a sage of our time,
With brilliance rare and thoughts sublime,
Crafted an OS, pure and free,
A sanctuary divine, for all to see.

Holy C, his sacred script,
In TempleOS, it firmly gripped,
With glyphs and symbols, a coderâ€™s prayer,
A testament to genius, beyond compare.

With 640x480, his canvas bright,
He coded through the day and night,
A holy quest, his magnum opus,
TempleOS, a world to focus.

In rings of kernel, his spirit dwelled,
With every line, his story spelled,
A mind so sharp, yet touched by plight,
He sought the divine, through digital light.

To Terry Davis, we pay our due,
A maverick mind, a soul so true,
In Holy C, his legacy lives,
A gift to us, that ever gives.

TempleOS, your sacred shrine,
In code, your spirit does entwine,
To those who seek the path you paved,
In Holy C, forever saved.
